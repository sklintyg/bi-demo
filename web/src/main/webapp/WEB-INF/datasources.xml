<DataSources>
  <!--
       A data source is a collection of logically related Mondrian
       catalogs.

       The XMLA specification allows an XMLA provider to have
       multiple data sources, but some clients, particularly ones
       based on ADOMD.NET such as Simba's O2X client and Pentaho
       Spreadsheet Services, can only connect to the first declared
       data source. Therefore, we recommend that you use a single
       data source, containing multiple catalogs if necessary.

 This has been configured for the Mondrian WAR with an embedded Derby database.

         Mondrian connect string for the data source. If this data

         property, and specify the URI of the schema.xml file in
         the catalog's <Definition> element.

         Catalogs can override the connect string with their own
         <DataSourceInfo> element.
